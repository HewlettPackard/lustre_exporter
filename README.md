* collector.mds=extended
* collector.client=extended
* collector.generic=extended

Flag Option Detailed Description

- disabled - Completely disable all metrics for this portion of a source.
- core - Enable this source, but only for metrics considered to be particularly useful.
- extended - Enable this source and include all metrics that the Lustre Exporter is aware of within it.

## What's exported?

All Lustre procfs and procsys data from all nodes running the Lustre Exporter that we perceive as valuable data is exported or can be added to be exported (we don't have any known major gaps that anyone cares about, so if you see something missing, please file an issue!).

See the issues tab for all known issues. This project is actively maintained by HPE, so you should see a reasonably quick response if you identify a gap.
